This repository contains a YAML file called "easytravel-k8s-deploy.yaml". This file contains every configuration needed to deploy a working easytravel deployment into an existing kubernetes cluster.

To deploy Easytravel using this file, first download the file to the box where you will be executing your "kubectl" commands from.
Once you have done that you can deploy Easytravel to the cluster using the command: "kubectl create -f easytravel-k8s-deploy.yaml"

Note that you will need to make sure you reference the correct path for the downloaded yaml file.


-----------------------
Once you have done this easytravel should start right up with traffic running automatically. There is nothing else needed to be done to start seeing data if you are monitoring this with Dynatrace.
The loadgenerator will automatically start running traffic on the application

This will create:
- a kubernetes namespace called "easytravel"
- 4 deployments:
  - easytravel-frontend
  - easytravel-backend
  - easytravel-mongodb
  - load generator
3 services
  - easytravel-frontend-service
  - easytravel-backend-service
  - easytravel-mongodb-service

You can confirm that these were all created succesfully by running the command:
"kubectl get all -n easytravel"

If you want to run traffic manually to your shiny new easytravel application, you can access it manually using the address: "http://<kubernetes-worker-node>:30080" where <kubernetes-worker-node> is the IP or DNS entry for any worker node in your Kubernetes cluster
